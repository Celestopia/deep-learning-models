# deep-learning-models
Data-driven time series prediction models for personal study.

All `README.md` files are for introduction purposes. Read them to understand the mechanism of every subdirectory.

All `example.ipynb` files are for demonstration purposes. Run them to see how the models work.

Annotations are in both English and Chinese. A large proportion is auto-generated by AI-assisted programming software.

Currently, GPU training is not enabled in the code. Maybe updated in the future.

`flight_data_prediction\` directory contains codes for multi-variate time series prediction of flight data. The dataset is collected from NASA.
